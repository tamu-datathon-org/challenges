# Celonis 2021 Challenge

## Introduction

The Pizzeria Mamma Mia is selling takeaway pizza. The business is generally going well, however, their customer ratings have been very low, and they are 
making negative profits for some of their deliveries. 

The owner of the Pizzeria, Giovanni, is puzzled: â€œI make my pizza by following the original recipe 
of my grand grandfather and everyone loves it! Still, customers complain and donâ€™t come back. I wonder if there is some way, I could look behind the processes
at the pizzeria to find the problem."

## Description

You have received three data sets that were taken from Pizzeria Mamma Miaâ€™s internal systems. These data sets can be pieced 
together to reconstruct Mamma Miaâ€™s pizza delivery process. Using these three data sets and your Celonis technology, you will be using process data mining to 
derive insights into Mamma Miaâ€™s processes, and help Giovanni improve his day-to-day operations. Turn to the next page to find your case challenge.

Please complete the following:
1. **Technical Component:**
   * Upload your given data and correctly link the data to upload a process reconstruction using your data model.
   * Create a data workspace that analyses different facets of the pizza delivery process You can refer to the example workspace within the tool. Your workspace 
   should include: **one process Component, one char or table, one KPI component, a conformance checking page, and either one selection or design component. (hint: you can refer to slides 11 - 20 in your reference packet for assistance)**
   * **Once you have created your workspace, answer the 8 analyses questions on the attached slide (optional).**
2. **Recommendations Component:**
   * Once you have created your workspace and answered your analyses questions (questions optional), your team will need to create a 1-page writeup or short video to pitch your findings to Giovanni and make the 
   case for business improvements. This should include the following: **Insights from your analyses, business recommendations for process improvement, and an uploaded process model from the original business process (see slide 21 in help packet)**
