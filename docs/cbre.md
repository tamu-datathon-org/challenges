## Description
To tell a story in a sequence is no mean task and more so in a comic strip. Each image in the attached compressed file tells a story. Parse the image, extract the text â€“ trying to retain the sequence of the conversation. Your model will be tested with similar kind of images to check if the conversational sequence is preserved. Good Luck -- Get them in order!

The compressed folder can be found [here](./cbre/training-strips.zip).
