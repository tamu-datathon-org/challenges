# CBRE Challenge: Get in Line

## Description
To tell a story in a sequence is no mean task and more so in a comic strip. Each image in the attached compressed file tells a story. Parse the image, extract the text – trying to retain the sequence of the conversation. Your model will be tested with similar kind of images to check if the conversational sequence is preserved. Good Luck -- Get them in order!

The compressed folder can be found [here](./cbre/training-strips.zip).

## CBRE Math Mini-Challenge

Two techs are set to meet randomly in the ballroom between 4pm and 5pm CT today. Each tech will not wait for more than 10 minutes for the other during the one-hour window. No one will wait beyond 5pm.
Code a program that spews out the probability that they will meet. Alternatively, solve it on paper and send a snap. 

Have fun; don’t fret about an exact solution.
